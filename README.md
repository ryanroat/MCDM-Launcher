# traversy-launcher
chrome extension 'launcher' project

built by following the Traversy Media tutorial
"Build & Publish a Custom Google Chrome Extension"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHZCYi1K664

modified during initial build to point at social media and other online resources by and about Matt Colville 
and his discussions of Dungeons and Dragons, as well as his self published books

(yes, the color scheme is, well, a thing, but it's reflective of the Atari game Adventure,
which Matt uses as a branding reference)

Custom JavaScript code to make a random catchphrase appear on each instance.

This project also required editing and resizing various image elements in GIMP.
